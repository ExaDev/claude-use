/**
 * Rewrites the `$id` of every generated schema in `schema/*.schema.json` to the real, version-pinned GitHub Release asset URL for the given tag: `https://github.com/ExaDev/claude-use/releases/download/<tag>/<file>`.
 *
 * This is deliberately different from install.sh's own `releases/latest/download/...` URL: the installer always wants the newest release, but a schema an editor references from a config file's own `$schema` field must stay stable at whatever version that config was written against — it must never shift underfoot on a later release the way `latest` would.
 *
 * Run at publish time only (from `release.yml`, right before the schema files are uploaded as release assets), never as part of `pnpm schema` — `scripts/gen-schema.mts` writes a placeholder `$id` with no notion of a release tag, and this script's rewrite is a separate, deliberate step layered on top of that output.
 *
 * Usage: node scripts/stamp-schema-ids.mjs <tag> The tag may also come from the `GITHUB_REF_NAME` environment variable (as GitHub Actions sets it for a tag-triggered workflow run), used when no argv tag is given.
