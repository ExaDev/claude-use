 * `statFileMode` returns the file's POSIX mode bits if `candidate` exists as a regular file, or `undefined` otherwise (ENOENT collapsed to `undefined`, every other error still propagated by the real implementation).

/**
 * Resolves the absolute path to the currently-running claude-use/claude executable from the raw process/env facts a call site would otherwise read directly off `process` — passed explicitly so this is unit-testable without touching real process globals.
 *
 * This exists because `process.argv[1]` is not a reliable "path to my own executable" for a Node single-executable-application (SEA) binary the way it is for an ordinary Node script. Per Node's own SEA documentation, a SEA binary's `argv[1]` merely echoes back whatever string appeared on the command line — verbatim, with no path or PATH resolution applied by Node or the OS — whereas a shebang-invoked script (the npm/plain-Node case) genuinely receives its resolved script path there, because the kernel's shebang handling substitutes the shell's already-PATH-resolved pathname before Node ever starts. Concretely: typing the bare word `claude-use` at a shell prompt produces `argv[1] === "claude-use"` for a SEA binary (no directory component at all), which previously got fed straight into `fs.realpathSync`/`path.dirname` as if it were a real path — resolving relative to `process.cwd()` instead of wherever PATH actually found the binary, and throwing ENOENT the moment cwd didn't happen to contain a same-named file. Confirmed via a minimal instrumented SEA binary reproducing exactly this, and matching the exact failure every release verification job hit once invoking `claude-use`/`claude` as a bare PATH-resolved command rather than by absolute path.
 *
 * A second, separate wrinkle: some install channels invoke this binary through a re-exec wrapper rather than running it directly. Scoop's own shim (`~/scoop/shims/claude-use.exe`) is a compiled proxy (confirmed from its source: https://github.com/ScoopInstaller/Shim/blob/main/cs/shim.cs) that calls `CreateProcessW(null, cmd, ...)` with the real target's absolute path as the first token of `cmd` — per the Win32 `CreateProcess` contract, passing `lpApplicationName = null` means that first token becomes both the module launched *and* what the child receives as its own command line — so this process ends up seeing the real target's absolute path, living in a versioned app directory Scoop deliberately keeps off PATH, not the shim's own PATH-visible location. Placing the new `claude` alongside that path (as the Homebrew/direct-invocation case correctly does) would create a file PATH can never find. Confirmed against a real Scoop install: `claude-use shim enable` placed `claude.exe` next to the real target in the app directory, and the immediately following `claude --version` failed with "not recognized" because that directory was never on PATH.
 *
 * The redirect-if-not-on-PATH check below applies uniformly to whichever candidate we end up with — whether derived from a path-shaped `argv1`, or from the `execPath` fallback (`argv1` undefined) — since it's unconfirmed whether a Windows SEA binary duplicates `argv[0]` into `argv[1]` the same way the POSIX build does; treating both sources identically is strictly more robust either way and regresses nothing already confirmed working.
 *
 * The algorithm: if the raw candidate is a bare word with no path separator, it can only have been found via PATH lookup in the first place (Node/the OS applies no resolution to it at all), so search PATH ourselves for the first directory containing an executable of that name, reconstructing exactly what the shell already did. Otherwise, resolve it (or the `execPath` fallback) against cwd, then check whether the *resulting directory* is itself on PATH: if so, use it directly (the Homebrew/direct-invocation case — never realpath'd, since a package manager's PATH-visible entry is often a symlink elsewhere, e.g. Homebrew's `/opt/homebrew/bin/claude-use` -> its own Cellar keg, and callers need that PATH-visible location, not the dereferenced target). If that directory is *not* on PATH (the Scoop re-exec case above), search PATH for a separately-installed entry sharing our own invoked basename before falling back to the direct candidate.
