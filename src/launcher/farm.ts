Doing it after means the scratch tree never holds unique data at any point, which is what makes an orphaned scratch tree from a crashed run always safe to delete outright — see `recoverInterruptedSwap`.
 *
 * The window in which no directory exists at `farmRoot` is one rename wide. Concurrent *resyncs* cannot observe it at all, because the per-identity lock serialises them; a concurrent `claude` process already running under this identity can, which is inherent to replacing a directory a live process is reading and is why the window is kept to a single syscall.

 * Brings one identity's farm into line with the cascade resolved for the current directory, and hands back everything the launcher needs to go on and spawn the real binary.
 *
 * The order below is fixed and each step depends on the one before it:
 *
 * 1. Take the per-identity lock, so two sessions under one identity in two directories cannot rewrite the same farm toward two different states at once.
 * 2. Finish or undo any swap a previous launch was killed in the middle of, so everything after this point sees a coherent farm.
 * 3. Read the previous manifest and, guided by it, list the parts of the still-live farm reconciliation is allowed to look at. This step only reads the farm; nothing mutates it.
 * 4. Adopt anything Claude Code wrote into a materialised directory back into the canonical `~/.claude`.
 * 5. **Then** build the fact manifest, from a canonical tree that now includes everything step 4 adopted. Building facts before adoption would make newly adopted data invisible to this resync and only visible on the next launch — the single most important ordering constraint in this module.
 * 6. Resolve the cascade and plan the farm, both of them pure functions over those facts.
 * 7. If the plan matches what the farm's manifest already records and step 4 adopted nothing, stop: no filesystem write happens at all. Launching repeatedly from the same directory with no configuration change is the overwhelmingly common case and it must stay cheap.
 * 8. Otherwise build a scratch tree, write its manifest, and swap it into place.
 * 9. Release the lock — before the real binary is spawned, never held across it.
