 * Walks every `.<identity>.previous.*` directory still on disk and, for each top-level name that collides with the current farm, asks `decide` what to do rather than leaving it for a human to resolve by hand outside the tool.
 *
 * Reuses `carryOver`'s own collision detection rather than a second implementation: anything that does *not* collide has already been carried across automatically by an earlier resync, so this only ever has to ask about genuine conflicts — `carryOver`'s own `carried` list is not otherwise interesting here, and (when `classification` is given) its `autoResolved` list means `decide` is only ever called for a collision `carryOver` itself could not already settle.
 *
 * `keep-new` discards the old copy outright. `keep-old` removes the current farm's own entry at that name and moves the old copy into its place — the same rename `carryOver` already uses for a non-colliding name, just preceded by clearing the spot it collided with. `skip` leaves both copies exactly as they were, and the directory they live in is not removed, so a later run of this same function finds the exact same conflict again rather than silently losing track of it.
