This check sits *above* the entries lookup, not merely at the least-specific end of the cascade, and it fires on the path's **real classification**, never on a lexical reading of the key that matched it — so a glob written under a `runtime/` prefix that happens to reach `.credentials.json` is neutralised exactly like a deliberate `secret/` key would be.
 * 2. **Unclassified.** A top-level entry nothing recognises is not shared, and is reported rather than silently guessed at.
 * 3. **Entries rules**, most specific first, with a failing condition eliminating a candidate rather than ending the search.
 * 4. **The category**: a layer's own toggle if any layer set one, otherwise the shipped default.
