/**
 * Plans the write-through reconciliation pass that runs before each resync builds its new scratch tree.
 *
 * A materialised directory stops being a live view of `~/.claude` and becomes a locally-built directory of symlinks frozen at resync time. Anything Claude Code writes into it afterwards — a brand-new project subdirectory, a new session file inside an existing one — lands as a real, untracked child: invisible to every other identity, and liable to be read as stale scaffolding and pruned by a later resync. This pass finds that data and copies it back into the canonical `~/.claude`, where it belongs, before anything else happens.
 *
 * The manifest is what makes this possible at all. A directory the farm materialised and a directory Claude Code created look identical on disk, so without the previous resync's own record of what it built, there is no way to tell the two apart. When the manifest is missing or unreadable, the pass falls back to **conservative mode** — every real directory in the farm is treated as materialised, so every real child anywhere becomes an adopt candidate — and reports it. That is deliberately over-eager rather than a silent no-op: over-adopting copies data into the place it was always meant to live, while under-adopting loses it.
 *
 * The pass is deliberately independent of the *new* resolved state. A directory whose new decision is `omit`, or one collapsing back from materialised to a plain symlink, still gets reconciled first — those are precisely the cases where the data would otherwise be discarded, which is the whole reason this exists.
 *
 * It is also idempotent: re-running against the same old farm after a crash mid-resync produces only `skip("identical-content")` for anything the interrupted run already copied across.
