 * Linearises a profile's `extends` graph into a base-first order.
 *
 * The walker keeps **two separate structures**, and the distinction is load-bearing rather than stylistic:
 *
 * - `stack` is the current depth-first path. A name already on it means the graph genuinely loops back on itself, which is the only real cycle.
 * - `visited` is every name already emitted anywhere in the walk. A name already in it is a diamond — two branches sharing a base — and must simply be skipped, not re-emitted.
 *
 * Collapsing the two into one shared set produces a silent wrong answer in either direction. Using `stack` alone re-emits a shared base a second time in a diamond, so the base's values get re-applied on top of an intermediate profile that deliberately overrode them — the override silently disappears. Using `visited` alone false-flags every legitimate diamond as a cycle. Neither failure crashes; both just resolve to the wrong configuration.
 *
 * Emission is **post-order**: a profile is appended only after everything it extends, so `c extends [a, b]` where both extend `base` linearises to `[base, a, b, c]` — never `[base, a, base, b, c]`.
