/**
 * Turns a resolved set of decisions into a concrete farm layout.
 *
 * A directory becomes one symlink when the decision is uniform across its whole subtree, which is what keeps the common resync cheap — a few dozen top-level symlinks rather than a rebuilt tree. It is materialised, and recursed into, when either:
 *
 * - its subtree's decisions genuinely disagree, so no single symlink can express the outcome; or
 * - **any** conditional entries rule could reach something under it, even when today's evaluation happens to be uniform. This second case is the one a naive "is the decision uniform right now" check gets wrong: a symlinked directory freezes the decision for every file Claude Code creates *after* the resync, so a `newerThan` condition meant to share recent sessions would never see a session written five minutes from now. The bug only surfaces for files that do not exist yet, which is precisely why the check has to be structural rather than observational.
 *
 * Every symlink target is `<claudeHome>/<rel>`, unconditionally. That matters for the entries inside a materialised directory that are themselves relative symlinks escaping `~/.claude` (a real condition, not a hypothetical one — a skills directory linked out to a separate dotfiles repository, for instance). Copying such a link's own relative target verbatim would resolve to a different place from the farm's own depth, and copying its resolved absolute target would pin the farm to wherever that link pointed at resync time. Linking at `<claudeHome>/<rel>` and letting the OS follow the remaining hops from there is the only form that stays correct.
