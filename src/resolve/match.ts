 * 1. **Different layers — the later layer wins, period.** This rank sits deliberately *above* exactness. Ranking exactness first would let an untrusted committed `.claude-use.json`'s exact key beat your own later, personal glob override, breaking the design's stated trust property that a directory-scoped local rule can only ever tighten what a committed file opened, never the reverse. Nothing in the design asserts that an earlier exact key beats a later glob, so nothing is lost by closing that hole.
 * 2. Same layer: an exact literal beats a glob.
 * 3. Same layer: the longer literal prefix wins.
 * 4. Same layer: more path segments wins, which separates a one-wildcard pattern from a two-wildcard one at the same depth.
 * 5. Same layer: the later ordinal — source order within the file — wins.
 * 6. Canonical pattern, compared as a string, as a last-resort determinism guarantee.
 *
 * The order must be **total**: returning 0 for two distinct rules would make the winner depend on iteration order, which tests would only catch intermittently.
