/**
 * Forward-only encoding of a real working directory into the single directory name Claude Code gives it under `~/.claude/projects/`.
 *
 * The encoding collapses the *entire* non-alphanumeric character class to `-`, not just the path separator: `.`, `_`, ` `, `@`, and `/` all become `-`, while letters and digits pass through with their case preserved. This was confirmed against a real installation's project directories, not assumed from the one `/`-becomes-`-` sample the README quotes.
 *
 * The encoding is therefore many-to-one: `~/work/clients/acme`, `~/work/clients-acme`, and `~/work-clients/acme` all produce the identical name. That makes it impossible to invert, so this module never tries: there is no decode function here, and `projects.test.ts` asserts the module's export list to keep it that way. Only the forward direction — real path to encoded name — is ever computed, and `detectEncodingAmbiguity` reports when a pattern's encoded form could plausibly correspond to more than one real path rather than resolving it silently.
